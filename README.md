# Netflix-Contents-Data-Analysis-Using-Python
## Business understanding
In this project we use a dataset of the contents of Netflix to answer the following questions:
•	Understanding what content is available in different countries
•	Is Netflix increasingly focusing on TV rather than movies in recent years.
•	Analysis of TV Shows & Movies Content Ratings

## Data understanding
The data is taken from Kaggle, and the csv file is provided here as well.

## Prepare data
### Data wrangling and cleaning
A quick look at the contents quamtity on Netflix shows that there are more than twice the number of moview (68.4%) than TV Shows (31.6% on Netflix)
### Libraries
This involves the use of common Python libraries:
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import plotly.express as px
%matplotlib inline

## Table of Contents
### Utilized descriptive and inferential statitistics to help answer the given questions

    There still seems to be more movies added than TV shows and the proportion of TV shows added has been declining over the years.

## Key findings
    Maximum movies and TV shows are available from USA, followed by India, UK, Canada, and Japan.
