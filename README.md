# Netflix-Contents-Data-Analysis-Using-Python
In this project we use a dataset of the contents of Netflix to answer the following questions:
•	Understanding what content is available in different countries
•	Is Netflix increasingly focusing on TV rather than movies in recent years.
•	Analysis of TV Shows & Movies Content Ratings

## Data
The data is taken from Kaggle, and the csv file is provided here as well.

## Libraries
This involves the use of common Python libraries:
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import plotly.express as px
%matplotlib inline
